    <h2>The ENIAC - 1943</h2>
        <p>The ENIAC started in 1943. The ENIAC was a type of computing system
          and it was built by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert . The ENIAC was
          built at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering of the University of
          Pennsylvania. It was about 1,000 times faster then any other computer in
          previous years. Besides being a computer it was also an Electronic Numerical
          Integrator. It was able to solve many different types of numerical problems.
          The ENIAC was very large it took up about 1,000 square feet and was 30
          tons in weight. It also had panel to panel wiring and switching with
          about 18,000 vacuum tubes. It is said that is has probably done more
          calculations in its 10 years in operation in all of humanity until that
          time. The ENIAC is probably what helped the development of many other
          electronic developments like calculators, phone and more developed
          computers.
